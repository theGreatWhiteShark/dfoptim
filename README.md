# Why I did this fork:
For my package [climex](https://github.com/theGreatWhiteShark/climex) I needed an optimization function that provides me with ALL the updates it is performing in order to do an animation.

Since the **dfoptim** package contains the Nelder-Mead routine written in R instead of C it was more easy and fast to modify.
